```
A scammer is known for targeting victims through phishing and frequently uses pig butchering tactics to steal their cryptocurrency.
You’ve spoken with one of the victims, who shared the only piece of evidence they have: an image the scammer consistently sends as a joke once the funds have been drained (apparently, he's an Instagram brainroted).

Your objective is to extract as much information as possible from this image to help locate the scammer and report them to the C3N brigade.

This challenge is divided into two parts.
